## FlipCoinGame
##My First JS assignment at Metropolia: FlipCoinGame
#First, user chooses his choice: head or reverse.
#Then, user throws the coin and he could see his random chance as winning or losing. If the coin side is the same as his choice, he wins. Otherwise, he loses.
#This app will count how many times he wins. Also it counts total times of throwning the coin. 
#User needs to refresh before starting the game again.
